		<h2>How it all started...</h2>
		Allow me to set the setting, it is 2012 and tumblr is what everyone my age is using.
		Tumblr became a hub on the internet where teenagers like me found comfort.

		I 'rebloged' posts that I could relate to and edited my page (blog) to appeal to the aesthic of my content.
	 	I would usually look up 'tumblr layouts' and copy and paste the random words to my editor, or I used the tumblr templates provided.
		One day, out of curiosity, I began to mess with the random words that seemed like a foreign language to me.
		I was messing with the HTML and CSS for my blog. I was fascinated by the way the computer followed my input.
		I started to google what the syntax meant, and taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS.
		This was my first exposure to Computer Science!

		<h2>And it continues... </h2>
		I remember the exact moment in high school when I became aware that girls like me, did not code.
		As I left my first programming class, with my tote and heeled boots, I observed the line of white teenage boys that I shadowed out the door.
		This visual made me realize that I might spend my life working in a field where I may be one of few women in the room, maybe even the only woman of color.
		My career objectives greatly reflect upon the values I hold high in my life.
		These values are equality, learning and innovation.
		Diversity and inclusion are now conversations that we are starting have in STEM disciplines.

	<h2>In the future...</h2>
	I want to give back to my community. And I also will continue to
	encourage ad promote divesity and inclusion in STEM where ever I go.
