    <h2>HOW I STARTED</h2>
    Allow me to set the setting, it is 2012 and tumblr is what everyone my age is using.
    Tumblr became a hub on the internet where teenagers like me found comfort.

    I 'rebloged' posts that I could relate to and edited my page (blog) to appeal to the aesthic of my content.
    I would look up 'tumblr layouts' then copy and paste the random words onto my editor, or I used the tumblr templates provided.
    One day, out of <a type ="ital">curiosity<a>, I began to mess with the random words that seemed like a foreign language to me.
      I was messing with the HTML and CSS for my blog. I was fascinated by the way the computer followed my input.
      I started to google what the syntax meant, and taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS.
      This was my first exposure to Computer Science!

      <h2>DIVERSITY & INCLUSION MATTERS TO <a type="ital">ME</a></h2>
      I remember the exact moment in high school when I became aware that girls like me, did not code.
      As I left my first programming class, with my tote and heeled boots, I observed the line of white teenage boys that I shadowed out the door.
      This visual made me realize that I might spend my life working in a field where I may be one of few women in the room, maybe even the only woman of color.
      <a type="ital">My career objectives greatly reflect upon the values I hold high in my life.
        These values are equality, learning and innovation.

      <h2>MOVING FORWARD</h2>
      Diversity and inclusion are now important topics we are starting to address in STEM disciplines. But it is not enough.

      As a first-gen student, I struggled to find comfort in college, especially in my field.
      The students I share classrooms are nothing like me. It can be hard to find a place to fit in when the entire instiution is made for you not to.
