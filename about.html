            I'm a product of migration.  <img src="images/butter.png" alt="" width="18" height="18" class="butterfly"/>
            I'm a Mexican-American first generation.
            I grew up in Chicago in a predominatnly Latinx neighborhood on the West Side of the city.

            La Villita is a vibrant community that translates to "small village".
            This is the place I called home for my first 18 years...

    		<h2>How it all started</h2>
    		Allow me to set the setting, it is 2012 and tumblr is what everyone my age is using.
    		Tumblr became a hub on the internet where teenagers like me found comfort.

    		I 'rebloged' posts that I could relate to and edited my page (blog) to appeal to the aesthic of my content.
    	 	I would usually look up 'tumblr layouts' and copy and paste the random words to my editor, or I used the tumblr templates provided.
    		One day, out of curiosity, I began to mess with the random words that seemed like a foreign language to me.
    		I was messing with the HTML and CSS for my blog. I was fascinated by the way the computer followed my input.
    		I started to google what the syntax meant, and taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS.
    		This was my first exposure to Computer Science!

    		<br>
    		<h2>And it continues... </h2>
    		I remember the exact moment in high school when I became aware that girls like me, did not code.
    		As I left my first programming class, with my tote and heeled boots, I observed the line of white teenage boys that I shadowed out the door.
    		This visual made me realize that I might spend my life working in a field where I may be one of few women in the room, maybe even the only woman of color.
    		My career objectives greatly reflect upon the values I hold high in my life.
    		These values are equality, learning and innovation.
    		Diversity and inclusion are now conversations that we are starting have in STEM disciplines.
    		I

    	<h2>In the future...</h2>
    	I want to give back to my community. And I also will continue to
    	encourage ad promote divesity and inclusion in STEM where ever I go.
