    		<h2>How it all started</h2>
    		Allow me to set the setting, it is 2012 and tumblr is what everyone my age is using.
    		Tumblr became a hub on the internet where teenagers like me found comfort.

    		I 'rebloged' posts that I could relate to and edited my page (blog) to appeal to the aesthic of my content.
    	 	I would look up 'tumblr layouts' then copy and paste the random words onto my editor, or I used the tumblr templates provided.
    		One day, out of <a type ="ital">curiosity<a>, I began to mess with the random words that seemed like a foreign language to me.
    		I was messing with the HTML and CSS for my blog. I was fascinated by the way the computer followed my input.
    		I started to google what the syntax meant, and taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS.
    		This was my first exposure to Computer Science!

    		<h2>Why Diversity & Inclusion Matters to <a type="ital">Me</a></h2>
    		I remember the exact moment in high school when I became aware that girls like me, did not code.
    		As I left my first programming class, with my tote and heeled boots, I observed the line of white teenage boys that I shadowed out the door.
    		This visual made me realize that I might spend my life working in a field where I may be one of few women in the room, maybe even the only woman of color.
    		<a type="ital">My career objectives greatly reflect upon the values I hold high in my life.
    		These values are equality, learning and innovation.
      </a>
    		Diversity and inclusion are now conversations that we are starting have in STEM disciplines.
